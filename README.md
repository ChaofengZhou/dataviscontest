# Why and when do Students change Majors?

This is a contribution to the [IEEE VGTC VPG Data-Visualization Contest](http://vacommunity.org/ieeevpg/2015/index.html). The goal of the contest is to understand perceived vs. actual student interest in majors and to understand whether students that are determined a good fit for their major stay in it more commonly than those who are not.

The interactive tool is available at [http://keivnlee.github.io/dataviscontest/](http://keivnlee.github.io/dataviscontest/).
